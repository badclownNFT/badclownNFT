## Safety First

- Never open any links that are not from the official Twitter or Discord.
- Turn off DMs in Discord. The community will never DM you directly, it's probably a scam.
- Protect yourself with a hardware / cold wallet.
- Keep your Metamask pass phrase written down somewhere safe. There is no way to recover it.
- Do not interact with NFTs that you did not buy yourself. E.g. In hidden folder.
- Always make sure you are on the correct minting site and the correct OpenSea collection.

Now to find a collection that you believe in. This is a process on it's own. Do not search OpenSea there are too many scams on there. Use a link from the official Twitter or Discord.

Once you've found your long HODL you need to find the right NFT. If a project is selling fast you won't want to buy off the top 2 rows, but try and find something that suits your taste and budget. You can look at the rarity tools in the [Useful Links](#useful-links) section or you can go with your gut.

Click through to the NFT page itself. Often the items on the floor have already been sold and you risk losing gas if you are not careful.

If you see the big blue "Buy now" button you've got a chance. Click it.

![image info](./images/os_8_humans.png)

Check the box to confirm the purchase. You'll need enough funds in your wallet to continue. Click the "Confirm checkout" button.

![image info](./images/os_9_humans.png)

Metamask will open and will give you an estimate gas fee. If you have enough funds for the transaction and the gas the "Confirm" button will be active. If you are happy with your purchase click the button.
